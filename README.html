<h2>CalDAV reader & writer</h2>

React upon events and manage calendar information from a CalDAV server.

Features:

<ul>
  <li>Read events from a CalDAV calendar to:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Create nodes with the event's information</li>
    <li>Announce the events via email</li>
    <li>Works well with other modules. For example, you can use the <a href="https://drupal.org/project/twitter"
        title="Twitter Module">Twitter Module</a> to tweet events
  </ul>

  <li>Create weekly events into the calendar. For example, you can send weekly invitations to a list of users who should
    hold a presentation</li>
</ul>


<h3>Dependencies</h3>

None

<h3>Use</h3>

Go to the Module's configuration page. The configuration should be self-explained. If not, please <a

<h3>Status & Testability</h3>

This is a new sandbox project. However, the module has been successfully used in a medium-size site for half a year
already.

In theory, every CalDAV server should work. Popular CalDAV servers are for instance <a
  href="http://www.davical.org/">DAViCal</a> or <a
  href="https://support.google.com/calendar/?hl=en#topic=3417927">Google Calendar</a>.

In practice, the module was tested with the following servers:

<ul>
  <li>DAViCal</li>
</ul>

<h4>Drupal Version</h4>

This module is for Drupal 7.

<h3>Maintenance</h3>

I wrote this module for my own needs.

I can only maintain and extend the module if people show interest and I receive some paid contribution. For example
hired services or a donation:

Thanks! :)
